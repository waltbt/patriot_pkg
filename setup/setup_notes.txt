These setup files include files for all the devices that can work with PiTracker.cpp.
As the TrackerControl.cpp is written for the PatriotHS, the setup files only set that up.
I have included the rest to allow a user to setup a different device if desired.
The template of the install.bash code can be followed to include additional devices.
(Make sure it is an executable)
install_all.bash installs files for all the devices.
